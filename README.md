## Credits

- The initial layout of the website was inspired by the [Love Running Project](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LRFX101+2023_Q2/courseware/e805068059af42af87681032aa64053f/7525117e5cd144daa2a7b0c57843bbee/), providing a foundational structure for the pages.

- I utilized the navigation bar design from the [Love Running Project](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LRFX101+2023_Q2/courseware/e805068059af42af87681032aa64053f/7525117e5cd144daa2a7b0c57843bbee/) to ensure a user-friendly and consistent navigation experience.

- The responsive equal-height images with CSS, featured in the card formats on the 'About' page, were adapted from a helpful demonstration on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/sarus/pen/PJGPmy).

- The making of the hero image was done by utilizing the same method used in the [Love Running Project](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LRFX101+2023_Q2/courseware/e805068059af42af87681032aa64053f/92a91cf7fcee4361a2af651b7827a341/?child=first)

- I learned to implement a dark mode for maps within iframes from a tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIlHLFM03qs), enhancing the visual appeal of location details.

- I got a bit of an idea of making this website when it comes to the button that links to different pages and the card formats that change to column or row format depending on the screensize of the device from [SubaxTech website](https://yasirwiifto.github.io/SubaxTech/)
